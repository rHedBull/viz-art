# Feature Specification: Multi-Modal Visualization with Point Cloud Support

**Feature Branch**: `002-multimodal-viz`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Multi-modal visualization with point cloud support and enhanced interactive visualizations for the vision pipeline"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Process Point Cloud Through Pipeline (Priority: P1)

A vision engineer wants to run point cloud data (e.g., from LiDAR sensors) through the existing pipeline architecture alongside images, enabling multi-modal sensor fusion workflows.

**Why this priority**: Point cloud support is the core capability that enables all other multi-modal features. Without this foundation, none of the visualization or validation features can work with 3D data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading a .pcd or .ply file, passing it through a pipeline with a point cloud processing stage, and verifying the output contains the processed point cloud data. Delivers immediate value for users working with 3D sensor data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pipeline configured with point cloud processing stages, **When** a user provides a .pcd file as input, **Then** the pipeline successfully loads and processes the point cloud through all stages
2. **Given** a multi-modal pipeline, **When** a user provides both an image and point cloud, **Then** the pipeline processes both data types and maintains their associations
3. **Given** a point cloud processing stage, **When** the stage completes execution, **Then** the output point cloud is saved in the configured format (.pcd, .ply, or .xyz)

### User Story 2 - Visualize Point Clouds Interactively (Priority: P1)

A user wants to view 3D point cloud data interactively with rotation, zoom, and filtering capabilities to understand the spatial structure and identify issues in the data or processing results.

**Why this priority**: Visual feedback is essential for debugging and validating 3D data processing. Without visualization, users cannot effectively work with point cloud data.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading any point cloud file and verifying the interactive 3D viewer displays the data with working rotation/zoom controls. Delivers immediate debugging and inspection value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a processed point cloud result, **When** a user views the output in the UI, **Then** an interactive 3D viewer displays the point cloud with rotation and zoom controls
2. **Given** a point cloud visualization, **When** a user applies color-coding by height or intensity, **Then** the viewer updates to show the selected visualization mode
3. **Given** a large point cloud, **When** a user applies spatial filtering, **Then** the viewer shows only points within the selected region without lag

---

### User Story 3 - View Stage-by-Stage Outputs (Priority: P1)

A pipeline developer wants to inspect intermediate outputs from each processing stage to debug issues and verify that each stage produces expected results for both images and point clouds.

**Why this priority**: Stage-by-stage inspection is critical for debugging multi-stage pipelines. This is the primary use case for visualization in development workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a multi-stage pipeline and verifying that each stage's output (both image and point cloud) is displayed separately with appropriate viewers. Delivers immediate debugging value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a multi-stage pipeline execution, **When** a user views the results, **Then** the UI displays outputs from each stage with appropriate viewers (image viewer for images, 3D viewer for point clouds)
2. **Given** stage outputs with errors, **When** a user inspects a failed stage, **Then** the visualization clearly indicates the error and shows the last valid output
3. **Given** saved stage outputs from OutputSaver, **When** a user browses historical runs, **Then** the UI loads and displays both image and point cloud artifacts from any past execution

---

### User Story 4 - Overlay Point Clouds on Images (Priority: P2)

A user wants to project 3D point cloud data onto corresponding 2D images to verify sensor alignment and validate multi-modal fusion algorithms.

**Why this priority**: Multi-modal overlay is essential for sensor fusion workflows but requires point cloud processing to be working first. It's a natural next step after basic visualization.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading calibrated image and point cloud pairs, then verifying the overlay view correctly projects 3D points onto the 2D image plane. Delivers value for sensor calibration and fusion validation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a calibrated camera and LiDAR pair, **When** a user requests an overlay view, **Then** the 3D points are correctly projected onto the 2D image with color coding
2. **Given** an overlay visualization, **When** a user adjusts transparency, **Then** the image and point cloud blend smoothly for better inspection
3. **Given** misaligned sensors, **When** a user views the overlay, **Then** the misalignment is visually apparent, enabling calibration debugging

---

### User Story 5 - Validate Multi-Modal Data Quality (Priority: P2)

A data engineer wants automatic validation of point cloud inputs (checking for empty clouds, invalid coordinates, corrupted data) to catch data quality issues before expensive processing.

**Why this priority**: Data validation prevents wasted computation on bad inputs and improves pipeline reliability. It's important but not blocking for initial point cloud support.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing various corrupted or invalid point clouds and verifying the validation framework correctly identifies and reports each issue type. Delivers improved reliability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an empty point cloud file, **When** validation runs, **Then** the system rejects the input with a clear error message
2. **Given** a point cloud with NaN or infinite values, **When** validation runs, **Then** the system flags the invalid coordinates and reports their locations
3. **Given** configurable validation rules, **When** a user sets max/min point count thresholds, **Then** point clouds outside the range are rejected with appropriate warnings

---

### User Story 6 - Generate Point Cloud Thumbnails for Reports (Priority: P3)

A user wants automatically generated thumbnail images of point clouds in batch processing reports to quickly preview 3D data without opening interactive viewers.

**Why this priority**: Thumbnails improve report usability but aren't essential for core functionality. They're a nice-to-have enhancement for the batch processing HTML reports.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running batch processing with point cloud data and verifying the HTML report contains rendered thumbnail images. Delivers improved report usability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** batch processing with point cloud outputs, **When** the HTML report is generated, **Then** each point cloud result includes a rendered thumbnail image from a standard viewpoint
2. **Given** point cloud thumbnails in a report, **When** a user clicks a thumbnail, **Then** the system opens the full interactive 3D viewer
3. **Given** large point clouds, **When** thumbnails are generated, **Then** rendering completes within reasonable time without blocking the batch processing

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a point cloud file is corrupted or has an unsupported format?
- How does the system handle extremely large point clouds (millions of points) without crashing the viewer?
- What happens when calibration data is missing for image-point cloud overlay?
- How does the system respond when a stage expects point cloud input but receives image data?
- What happens when point cloud coordinates are in a different coordinate system than expected?
- How does the visualization handle point clouds with no color information (only XYZ coordinates)?
- What happens when a user tries to overlay point clouds on images with mismatched timestamps?
- How does the system handle point cloud files with invalid headers or metadata?
