# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Modal Visualization with Point Cloud Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on user needs and capabilities without mentioning specific implementation technologies. While Open3D, Plotly, and OutputSaver are mentioned, they are treated as required capabilities/integrations, not implementation choices.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All 30 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. No clarification markers present. Success criteria are all measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "under 5 seconds", "30+ FPS", "within 2 pixels").

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios. Success criteria align with user stories and are verifiable without implementation knowledge. Scope is well-defined with explicit "Out of Scope" section.

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. All mandatory sections are filled with concrete, testable requirements. The feature has clear priorities (P1-P3) allowing for incremental development and testing.

Key strengths:
- Well-prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Clear integration with existing Phase 1 OutputSaver architecture
- Measurable success criteria with specific performance targets
- Detailed assumptions and out-of-scope items
