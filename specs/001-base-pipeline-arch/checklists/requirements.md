# Specification Quality Checklist: Base Pipeline Architecture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items passed successfully. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✓ PASS
- Spec focuses on what the system should do (Pipeline class, Stage execution, configuration) without mentioning specific Python implementations
- User stories emphasize developer/user value (rapid pipeline creation, easy configuration, accessible UI)
- Language is accessible to business stakeholders with clear descriptions
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✓ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are fully specified
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001: "Pipeline base class orchestrates stages" can be verified through unit tests)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (5 minutes setup time, 30 seconds execution, 3 clicks, 70% coverage)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific APIs, databases, or code structure)
- All 4 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- 7 edge cases identified covering file validation, memory issues, failure handling, circular dependencies
- Scope boundaries clearly define Phase 1 inclusions and exclusions
- Dependencies (Python 3.8+, libraries) and assumptions (single-threaded, CPU-based) are documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✓ PASS
- Functional requirements map to user stories (FR-001-006 → Story 1, FR-007-010 → Story 2, FR-011-015 → Story 3, FR-016-018 → Story 4)
- User scenarios cover complete workflows: pipeline creation, configuration, UI interaction, testing
- Success criteria align with user stories (SC-001/002 for execution, SC-003 for configuration, SC-004 for UI, SC-005 for testing)
- No technology-specific details in the specification (uses abstract terms like "web interface", "configuration system", "testing framework")

**Conclusion**: Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.
