## Validation Details

### Content Quality Review
✓ **No implementation details**: The spec successfully avoids mentioning specific code structures, classes, or low-level implementation. References to libraries (torchmetrics, scikit-learn, Open3D, Streamlit) are kept at the dependency level, not in the requirements themselves.

✓ **User value focus**: All user stories clearly articulate the value proposition from the engineer's perspective (immediate accuracy feedback, systematic debugging, performance tracking).

✓ **Non-technical language**: The spec is written in plain language describing what users experience and achieve, not how the system works internally.

✓ **Mandatory sections**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✓ **No clarification markers**: The spec contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are fully specified.

✓ **Testable requirements**: All 22 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-022) are testable. Examples:
  - FR-001: Can verify accuracy counts are calculated by running test samples
  - FR-006: Can verify error browser loads artifacts by checking UI behavior
  - FR-019: Can verify custom metrics work by implementing a test plugin

✓ **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 success criteria include specific metrics:
  - SC-001: "within 1 second"
  - SC-004: "100% accuracy compared to reference implementations"
  - SC-009: "at least 70% of similar failures"
  - SC-010: "< 100ms for filtering/navigation"

✓ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on user experience and outcomes, not implementation:
  - SC-002: "in under 30 seconds using the error browser" (not "using Streamlit widget X")
  - SC-003: "load in under 2 seconds" (not "using PyArrow caching")

✓ **Acceptance scenarios**: Each of 4 user stories has 1-5 detailed Given/When/Then scenarios (13 total).

✓ **Edge cases**: 6 edge cases identified covering missing labels, corrupted data, format mismatches, large batches, exceptions, and point cloud alignment.

✓ **Scope boundaries**: Clear "Out of Scope" section with 9 items explicitly excluded (automatic labeling, active learning, distributed processing, etc.).

✓ **Dependencies and assumptions**: 5 dependencies and 10 assumptions documented, covering technical prerequisites and design decisions.

### Feature Readiness Review
✓ **Acceptance criteria**: All functional requirements are tied to acceptance scenarios through user stories. Each FR can be traced to a specific user story and acceptance scenario.

✓ **Primary flows covered**: User scenarios cover the complete workflow:
  - P1: Running validation and seeing accuracy (core flow)
  - P2: Debugging errors (secondary flow)
  - P3: Long-term monitoring (tertiary flow)
  - P4: Custom metrics (advanced flow)

✓ **Measurable outcomes**: The feature directly addresses all success criteria:
  - Real-time metrics (SC-001)
  - Error browsing (SC-002)
  - Visualization performance (SC-003)
  - Metric accuracy (SC-004)
  - Scale handling (SC-010)

✓ **No implementation leakage**: Success criteria avoid implementation details while remaining measurable. For example, SC-006 says "100 pipeline runs without performance degradation" rather than specifying database choice or caching strategy.

## Notes

All validation items passed on first review. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to begin implementation planning.

**Quality Assessment**: High quality specification with clear user value, complete requirements, measurable outcomes, and well-defined scope boundaries.
