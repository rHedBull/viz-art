## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Per-Stage Accuracy in Pipeline Reports (Priority: P1)

A vision engineer runs their multi-modal pipeline on a validation dataset with ground truth labels. After the full pipeline completes execution, they open the generated report to review per-stage performance metrics. The report shows accuracy counts (correct/wrong/invalid/unlabeled) for each stage, along with detailed metrics (precision, recall, F1, mAP, IoU) with ground truth comparisons. This allows them to evaluate if the pipeline performed as expected and identify which stages need improvement.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - knowing pipeline accuracy after execution. Without this, users have no way to evaluate if their pipeline is working correctly. This alone provides actionable value and catches major issues for systematic improvement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a single sample through a pipeline with one ground truth label and verifying that accuracy metrics appear in the generated report after execution. Delivers immediate value by showing if predictions match expected results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pipeline configured with ground truth labels loaded, **When** a user runs the pipeline on a validation sample and it completes, **Then** accuracy counts (correct/wrong/invalid/unlabeled) display for each stage in the generated report
2. **Given** a pipeline run completes successfully, **When** the user views the generated report, **Then** per-stage metrics (precision, recall, F1, mAP, IoU) are displayed with ground truth comparison
3. **Given** a completed pipeline run, **When** accuracy falls below a configured threshold for any stage, **Then** the report highlights the warning with the failing stage

### User Story 2 - Browse and Debug Error Cases (Priority: P2)

A vision engineer notices their pipeline has 15% error rate on a validation set by reviewing the HTML report. They click a link in the report to open the error case browser, which automatically loads saved error outputs from the validation run. They can filter errors by stage (e.g., "detection failures"), view side-by-side comparisons of predictions vs ground truth, and see image/point cloud diff visualizations with color-coded error regions. The system automatically categorizes errors by type and severity, helping them identify patterns.

**Why this priority**: After knowing accuracy (P1), users need to understand *why* failures happen. This enables systematic debugging rather than random guessing. Without this, users can see problems but cannot fix them efficiently.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a pipeline run with known failure cases, verifying the error browser loads saved artifacts, and checking that side-by-side visualizations display correctly. Delivers value by making debugging systematic.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a validation run with saved error outputs, **When** the user opens the error case browser, **Then** all failure cases are listed with thumbnails and error metadata (stage, type, severity)
2. **Given** an error case is selected, **When** the user views it, **Then** side-by-side visualization shows prediction vs ground truth with interactive zoom/pan
3. **Given** image errors are displayed, **When** the user toggles diff mode, **Then** color-coded difference visualization highlights mismatched regions
4. **Given** point cloud errors are displayed, **When** the user views the diff, **Then** distance error heatmap shows per-point errors with color scale
5. **Given** multiple errors exist, **When** the user applies filters (stage/type/severity), **Then** only matching errors are displayed in the browser

---

### User Story 3 - Track Performance Trends Over Time (Priority: P3)

A vision engineer has been improving their pipeline over several weeks. They open the historical comparison HTML report (linked from any per-run report) and see accuracy trends for each stage plotted over time. They can compare different pipeline versions, see which changes improved accuracy, and identify if recent changes caused regressions. Confusion matrices and performance breakdown charts help them understand model behavior patterns.

**Why this priority**: After debugging individual errors (P2), users need long-term visibility to track improvements and catch regressions. This enables data-driven decisions about which changes actually help. Less critical than P1/P2 because it requires multiple runs to be useful.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a pipeline multiple times with different configurations, verifying historical data is stored, and checking that trend charts display correctly in the static HTML historical report. Delivers value by enabling performance comparison and regression detection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple pipeline runs have been executed, **When** the user opens the historical comparison HTML report, **Then** accuracy trends are plotted over time for each stage
2. **Given** different pipeline versions have been tested, **When** the historical report is generated, **Then** side-by-side performance metrics are displayed with delta calculations
3. **Given** historical data exists, **When** the user views stage breakdown in the report, **Then** confusion matrices and per-class performance charts are displayed
4. **Given** a performance regression is detected, **When** the historical report is generated and accuracy drops below previous baseline, **Then** the report highlights the regression with affected stages

### Edge Cases

- What happens when ground truth labels are missing for some samples? (System should mark them as "unlabeled" and exclude from accuracy calculations while still showing counts)
- How does system handle invalid or corrupted ground truth data? (Validation should catch this and mark as "invalid" with error details in the UI)
- What if a stage produces outputs that don't match expected format for metric calculation? (System should log format mismatch error, mark as "invalid", and continue processing other samples)
- How does error browser handle very large batches with thousands of failures? (Pagination and filtering must work efficiently; thumbnail loading should be lazy/on-demand)
- How does system handle point cloud diff visualization when point counts don't match? (Use nearest-neighbor matching or ICP alignment before calculating distance errors)

- **Assumption 7**: Error severity levels will be categorized as Critical (pipeline fails), High (wrong output), Medium (degraded quality), Low (minor deviation)
- **Assumption 8**: Performance regression detection will use a simple threshold-based approach (e.g., accuracy drop > 5% from baseline) rather than statistical significance testing
- **Assumption 9**: The UI framework (Streamlit) supports embedding interactive visualizations (Plotly for 3D, OpenCV for images) without major performance issues
- **Assumption 10**: Historical performance data retention will default to 90 days with configurable cleanup policies

## Dependencies
