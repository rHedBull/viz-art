# Feature Specification: Performance Monitoring & Debugging System

**Feature Branch**: `003-multimodal-viz-phase3`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "multi-modal-viz phase3 from implementation.md with background in REQUIREMENTS.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Performance Diagnosis (Priority: P1)

A developer notices their pipeline is running slower than expected and needs to identify which stage is causing the bottleneck.

**Why this priority**: Performance visibility is critical for debugging and optimization. Without timing data, developers waste hours guessing which component needs improvement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a multi-stage pipeline and viewing per-stage execution times in the UI, delivering immediate diagnostic value without requiring other Phase 3 features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pipeline with 3 stages (preprocessing, detection, post-processing), **When** the pipeline executes, **Then** the UI displays execution time for each stage with millisecond precision
2. **Given** a pipeline run has completed, **When** viewing the performance dashboard, **Then** memory usage (CPU and GPU) is shown for each stage
3. **Given** multiple pipeline runs over time, **When** viewing performance trends, **Then** historical timing data is displayed as a chart showing performance changes

---

### User Story 2 - Debugging Failed Runs (Priority: P1)

A developer needs to understand why a specific pipeline run failed on certain inputs, requiring access to detailed logs and execution history.

**Why this priority**: Structured logging is essential for production readiness. Teams lose days debugging without proper audit trails showing exactly what happened during each run.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering a pipeline failure (e.g., invalid input), then querying the audit log by run ID to retrieve error details and execution metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pipeline run fails on frame 47, **When** the developer queries the audit log by run ID, **Then** they see timestamp, stage name, input path, error message, and performance metrics for that specific run
2. **Given** 100 pipeline runs over the past week, **When** the developer queries runs that failed at the "detection" stage, **Then** the system returns all matching run IDs with their error details
3. **Given** a successful pipeline run, **When** viewing the audit trail, **Then** the log shows links to all saved stage outputs (images, point clouds) for that run
4. **Given** the UI log viewer is open, **When** filtering by date range and stage name, **Then** matching log entries are displayed with the ability to export as JSON

---

### User Story 3 - Ground Truth Validation (Priority: P2)

A QA engineer needs to validate pipeline accuracy against labeled test data to ensure the system meets quality requirements before deployment.

**Why this priority**: While critical for production quality, ground truth integration can be tested independently after performance tracking exists. It's a natural next step after establishing observability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading a golden dataset with labels, running the pipeline, and viewing accuracy metrics (precision/recall/F1) in the UI without requiring export or other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a golden dataset with 50 labeled samples, **When** the pipeline processes them, **Then** the UI displays per-stage accuracy metrics (correct/wrong/invalid/unlabeled counts)
2. **Given** detection stage ground truth with bounding boxes, **When** comparing predictions to labels, **Then** the system calculates and displays precision, recall, F1 score, and mAP
3. **Given** multiple annotation formats (bboxes, segmentation masks, 3D points), **When** loading ground truth, **Then** the system correctly parses each format based on configurable schema
4. **Given** a pipeline run with ground truth, **When** viewing results, **Then** the error analysis browser shows failure cases with side-by-side prediction vs ground truth visualization

---

### User Story 4 - Performance Metrics Storage (Priority: P3)

A team lead needs to track pipeline performance over weeks/months to identify regressions and verify improvements from optimization work.

**Why this priority**: Historical metrics provide long-term value but aren't critical for initial debugging. This builds on P1 timing features by adding persistence.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the pipeline 10 times, confirming metrics are saved to Parquet files, then querying historical data by date range to view performance trends.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 10 pipeline runs over 3 days, **When** the developer queries performance history, **Then** the system returns timing and memory metrics for all runs stored in Parquet format
2. **Given** metrics storage is configured with a 30-day retention policy, **When** querying runs older than 30 days, **Then** the system has automatically cleaned up expired data
3. **Given** performance metrics from 100 runs, **When** viewing the performance dashboard, **Then** aggregate statistics (median, p95, p99 execution time) are displayed per stage

### Edge Cases

- What happens when memory usage exceeds system limits during a pipeline run?
- How does the system handle corrupted audit log files or incomplete run metadata?
- What happens if ground truth labels are missing for some samples in a dataset?
- How does the log viewer perform when querying thousands of runs?
- What happens when a stage crashes before timing data can be recorded?
- How does the system handle multiple annotation formats mixed in a single dataset?

## Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- PyArrow and Parquet libraries are available in the Python environment for metrics storage
- Loguru can be configured for structured JSON logging with automatic file rotation
- Ground truth labels follow standard formats (COCO for bboxes, PNG/NPY for segmentation, PLY/PCD with label attributes for 3D)
- GPU memory tracking uses standard CUDA APIs when available (gracefully degrades to CPU-only if GPU unavailable)
- OutputSaver from Phase 2 is already integrated and saving stage outputs to disk

### Data Assumptions
- Ground truth datasets fit in memory during validation runs (up to ~10GB typical)
- Annotation files use standard schemas that can be validated with Pydantic models
- Run IDs using UUID format provide sufficient uniqueness (collision probability negligible)
- Audit logs and metrics for a typical production workload fit on local disk (< 1TB over 6 months)

### User Assumptions
- Users have basic understanding of performance metrics (execution time, memory usage)
- Users can interpret standard ML metrics (precision, recall, F1, IoU, mAP)
- Users have access to the filesystem where audit logs and metrics are stored for debugging
- Users prefer filtering and querying logs via UI rather than command-line tools

### Integration Assumptions
- Performance overhead from timing and logging is acceptable (< 5% impact on total execution time)
- Existing pipeline stages can be instrumented without modifying their core logic
- UI framework (Streamlit/Gradio) supports real-time metric updates during pipeline execution
- Metric storage queries are infrequent enough that Parquet scanning is acceptable (vs database)

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Phase 2 multi-modal visualization features must be complete (OutputSaver, point cloud support)
- Python libraries: Loguru (logging), PyArrow (metrics storage), Pydantic (validation)
- UI framework must support dynamic chart rendering (Plotly integration)

### Internal Dependencies
- Pipeline execution framework must expose hooks for timing instrumentation
- Stage base class must support pre/post execution callbacks for logging
- OutputSaver must provide APIs for querying saved artifact paths by run ID

- Parallel batch processing optimization (deferred to Phase 5)
- REST API for querying metrics programmatically (deferred to Phase 5)
