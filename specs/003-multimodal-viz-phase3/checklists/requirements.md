# Specification Quality Checklist: Performance Monitoring & Debugging System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Summary
All checklist items passed successfully. The specification is ready for the next phase.

### Strengths
- **Clear prioritization**: User stories are properly prioritized (P1-P3) with independent test scenarios
- **Comprehensive requirements**: 28 functional requirements organized by category (Performance Profiling, Logging & Auditing, Ground Truth Integration, Data Management)
- **Measurable success criteria**: 10 specific, quantifiable outcomes with concrete metrics (e.g., "under 2 seconds", "100% capture rate", "70% compression ratio")
- **Well-defined entities**: 6 key data entities with clear relationships and attributes
- **Scope clarity**: Explicit "Out of Scope" section prevents scope creep
- **Technology-agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes rather than implementation details

### Technology References (Acceptable)
The spec mentions specific technologies (Loguru, PyArrow, Parquet, COCO format) but only in the context of:
1. External library dependencies clearly marked as such
2. Standard data formats (COCO, PLY, PCD) which are industry conventions
3. Assumptions section where technical constraints are documented
These are acceptable as they represent external constraints rather than implementation decisions.

### Edge Cases Coverage
Six edge cases identified covering:
- System resource limits
- Data corruption scenarios
- Missing data handling
- Performance at scale
- Crash recovery
- Mixed format handling

### Assumptions Documentation
Well-structured assumptions across four categories:
- Technical (5 items)
- Data (4 items)
- User (4 items)
- Integration (4 items)

All assumptions are reasonable and clearly stated, providing context for requirement interpretation.
