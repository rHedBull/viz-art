## Implementation Tips

### Priority Adjustments for Faster MVP
If you need results faster, consider this 2-week sprint approach:

**Week 1: Core + Visualization**
- Days 1-2: Basic pipeline (Phase 1.1)
- Day 3: Minimal UI (Phase 1.2)
- Days 4-5: Image visualization (Phase 2.2 partial)

**Week 2: Metrics + Polish**
- Days 6-7: Ground truth + metrics (Phase 3.3 + 4.1 partial)
- Day 8: Performance dashboard (Phase 4.3)
- Days 9-10: Documentation + examples

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Start with images only** - add point clouds in v2
2. **Use mock data initially** - real data complexity comes later
3. **Build UI incrementally** - basic first, enhance later
4. **Test with real users early** - get feedback by end of Phase 2

### Success Metrics
- Phase 1: Pipeline runs successfully
- Phase 2: Users can visualize results
- Phase 3: Can debug when things go wrong
- Phase 4: Know how well pipeline performs
- Phase 5: Ready for real projects
- Phase 6: Others can use it easily
